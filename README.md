## How it works 
  - No Sign-up / Sign-in.
  - Your data never leaves your browser, it stays in your browser unless you clear the todos.
  - Currently in _version-2_ the data of your todo is stored in your browser's local storage; so even if you close the website and revisit the website later, your     previous data will be automatially loaded from the local storage of browser.
  - üôÇ And yeah if you're wondering that it would be slow to load from local storage , __NOPE it loads crazy fast ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è__
  
  -***NOTE :*** __If you clear the browser-cache, you would lose all your data stored in the local-storageüò¨.__
  - ü§ûHoping to add some optional Cloud-storage options in upcoming versions.
